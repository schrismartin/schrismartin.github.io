While interning at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, initiaves were underway to reduce the Lab's environmental footprint. As a part of that, they requested an easy (and attractive) interface for tracking their progress toward a Power Usage Effectiveness and Water Usage Effectiveness score of an ideal 1.0. Facebook had created a [frontend](https://github.com/facebook/puewue-frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/facebook/puewue-backend) web application for tracking such data. Written in JavaScript and Ruby, the application displayed four metrics in near-realtime, and held on to historical data for up to 1 year. 

Converting Facebook's implementation to match the data and security infrustructure of ORNL played a large part in the project. Learning Ruby and JavaScript as well as interfacing with tools such as Redis and ElasticSearch made the experience educational and applicable outside ORNL. The web app is still in use internally today.
