Who Quote was a small project put together at HackGSU 2016 from concept to completion over the course of 36 hours. With this app, a user begins by picking from a list of categories.

Suppose the user picks "Politicians." Who Quote then scrapes twitter to from a list of pre-defined users to grab a tweet. The player must then identify the politician who said that quote.

A game consists of 5 quotes, and upon completion, you can see a list of your previous scores.

In future versions, we may decide to implement a global leaderboard as well as more categories. The current version only supports Politicians, but the backend can be updated to include more categories without needing an update for the app!
