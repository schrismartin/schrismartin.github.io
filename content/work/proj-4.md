About
-----
StudyLoop is a Web/iOS app imagined by [Alex Klibisz](http://alex.klibisz.com) and [Sam Rose](http://samrose.me) to help students collaborate with other students in their classes throughout their coursework at their university. Built to be modular and applicable to any university, StudyLoop allows selection of individual classes for your specific university and automatically puts you in a multi-room chat interface. Using "loops," students can break up each class by assignment, exam, etc and only subscribe to comments/messages built for that specific area of interest.

Involvement
-----------
My involvement with the project was exclusively on the iOS app. My time was spent concepting and implementing a better user-onboarding technique, as well as fixing UI elements and inner workings to bring a more polished and efficient experience. I introduced pagination of the chat interface, more efficient loop muting, app deep-linking with push notifications, among other smaller quality-of-life changes.
