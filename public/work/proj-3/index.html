<p>Available makes planning around others&rsquo; schedules much easier. Simply put in your events, be it a one-time baseball game or a repeating class, and Available shows everyone that you&rsquo;re not around to meet with others at those specific times. On the other hand, it makes planning events incredibly easy by showing you when your friends aren&rsquo;t available. Lunch time and you don&rsquo;t want to eat alone? Check in your favorites view to see which of your best friends are currently available! Trying to see a movie and you want to know what time to do it? Tack in all your friends and see when everyone&rsquo;s hanging around bored with nothing to do! Available makes planning small tasks incredibly easy, and with power features including avanced grouping, you can control who can see you&rsquo;re available and who can&rsquo;t!</p>

<h2 id="favorites">Favorites</h2>

<p>At a glance, see the status of up to ten of your best friends. Colored green when they&rsquo;re available and red when not, this screen makes it dead simple to see who&rsquo;s standing idle and who&rsquo;s too busy to hang out with you. If you&rsquo;re busy for a while and hoping to hang out with them soon, you can see how much longer they&rsquo;re busy or how much longer they&rsquo;re available.</p>

<hr />

<p><img align="left" width="200" style="margin: 20px" src="img/work/proj-3/img-2.png"></p>

<h2 id="compare">Compare</h2>

<p>The real power of Available comes in the compare function, where you can take up to 10 of your friends and find a time that fits in all of your schedules. If you&rsquo;re trying to figure out who&rsquo;s in the office and not in a meeting for a certain time, punch in all the members who need to be at the meeting and watch their combined available times show you exactly when you need to plan that celebratory birthday lunch. But be prepared - the more people you compare, the less time open time you&rsquo;ll see!</p>

<hr />

<p><img align="right" width="200" style="margin: 20px" src="img/work/proj-3/img-3.png"></p>

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>

<p>Available allows you to put all of your events in a single, linear system, giving you the freedom to distinguish which events are ones you want to block off for others, and others (like birthdays) that clutter your home calendar. The schedule view shows you how much time you have left in your current commitment, and also how much time you have available until your next! If you&rsquo;re planning on skipping your French class on Tuesday (skipping class is never advised), just swipe on the entry for that class and say you won&rsquo;t be there, and everyone will then see that you&rsquo;re down to hang out during that time!</p>

<p>Available intelligently puts &ldquo;breaks&rdquo; between your events when you only have a short amount of time between things. This way, your friends don&rsquo;t start texting you at every 30 minute break you have. You still need time to breathe!</p>

<hr />

<p><img align="left" width="200" style="margin: 20px" src="img/work/proj-3/img-4.png"></p>

<h2 id="profile">Profile</h2>

<p>Your profile is your one-stop-shop for seeing how other people can see you! Others&rsquo; profiles look identical to yours, so you can clearly see what kinds of free time your friends have to work with. The simple interface quickly gives you an idea of what kind of time you can heckle eachothers for, and shows those 30 minute breathers as &ldquo;busy,&rdquo; so you know you&rsquo;re not bothering someone who has only a few short minutes to make a mad dash across town between appointments. Available automatically connects to Facebook to get your profile picture and cover photo, but you can change these at any time to add your own personal touch.</p>

<p><img align="right" width="200" style="margin: 20px" src="img/work/proj-3/img-5.png"></p>

<h2 id="power-features">Power Features</h2>

<p>But you don&rsquo;t want the entire world to see when you&rsquo;re busy and when you&rsquo;re not. Available comes with its own friend system, so you can custom add whoever you want to be able to mutually share when you&rsquo;re not doing things. We take your Facebook friend list and cross reference it with who has the app. Send a request and have them approve it and you&rsquo;re good to go!</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not the only way you can distinguish who sees what. If you feel so inclined, you can create many different groups such as Work, BFF&rsquo;s, Running Club, and The Great Bakers. This way, when you make events, you can make yourself &ldquo;Selectively Available&rdquo; to members of that particular group! So if you&rsquo;ve got a cooking class you take in the evenings on Tuesday and Thursday, your friends in that class can see that you&rsquo;re busy, but that you&rsquo;ve decided that you&rsquo;ll kind-of be available to them for whatever reason. But everyone that isn&rsquo;t in that group will just see you as unavailable!</p>

<h2 id="technical">Technical</h2>

<p>This project was made during the days of the Parse BAAS Framework, which has sense been shut down. It is on my to-do list to write a custom backend and host it as a fully-functioning app. Furthermore, the app in its completion was only released as a Beta app through Apple&rsquo;s TestFlight program. Its availablility through TestFlight has since expired, but feel free to contact me if interested and I will attempt to quickly restore its place!</p>

<p>Further information can be found at on the app&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.available-app.com">www.available-app.com</a>.</p>
